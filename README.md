# BURT

Contains the latest version of my new project's (BURT) landing page
This version of the project includes a ThreeJs model, so opening index.html will not make the project appear completely. 
I tested with Visual Studio Code, WebStorm

In case you didn't have it on hand, I made it available online with the following link, on netlify.
